<h1 style="color: #4c8a46;">🚀 QA Launchpad Program </h1>

## 9 Weeks of Web Automation Challenge Series

I just joined a challenge where QAs all around the world challenged themselves to strengthen our programming skills, practice hands-on testing tasks, and build confidence as QA professionals.

This experience includes:

1. Weekly learning goals to keep us focused.
2. Hands-on exercises to put theory into practice.
3. Collaboration and peer learning.
4. Weekly meeting to review our tasks
5. Submissions through shared folders to track progress.
