## Week 3 - Assertions & Validations
This week covers test automation focusing on assertions and validations by using Playwright for web applications. Includes understanding how to use assertions to verify, creating manual test case document, and automating the same test cases.

### a. Programming Language

- JavaScript (Node.js) v22.14.0

### b. How to Run the Scripts
### c. Notes / Challenges

Topic:

    Assertions & Validations

Tools:

    Cypress / Playwright

Main Objectives

    Learn what assertions and validations are in test automation.

    Understand how to use assertions to verify:

    Page title

    Text content

    Button state (enabled/disabled)

    File upload functionality

    Write 3–5 manual test cases.

    Automate the same test cases using Cypress or Playwright.

Task Steps
Part 1 – Learning

    Study how assertions and validations work.

    Review built-in assertion commands or methods in your chosen tool.

    Understand the difference between implicit and explicit assertions.

Part 2 – Manual Test Cases

    Identify 3–5 scenarios to test (e.g., login, file upload, form validation).

    Document them clearly with test steps and expected results.

Part 3 – Automation

    Implement automation scripts for each manual test case.

    Use assertions to validate expected behavior.

    Include at least one scenario involving file upload.

Part 4 – Submission

Submit:

    Your manual test cases document.

    Your automated test scripts (via GitHub link or zipped folder).

Expected Deliverables

✅ Manual test case document (3–5 test cases).

✅ Automated scripts with assertions and validations.

✅ Demonstration of file upload automation.
